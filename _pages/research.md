## Research Overview

My research integrates polymer physics, dielectric spectroscopy, and nanocomposite engineering to advance energy
materials for next-generation electronics and storage technologies. Using broadband dielectric spectroscopy,
dynamic mechanical analysis, rheology, and calorimetry, combined with rigorous data modelling, I establish
structure–property relationships linking molecular dynamics to performance. This enables rational design of materials
with tailored electrical and mechanical properties. By optimizing processing and structure–property
relationships, my work advances scientific understanding and technological innovation to address global energy
challenges.
