Teaching is as vital as research in fulfilling a university’s mission—while research creates new knowledge, teaching ensures its meaningful transmission. I view teaching and mentoring as central to my academic purpose.

## Teaching & Mentorship Experience

Upon receiving my undergraduate degree, I had the opportunity to teach and mentor undergraduate and postgraduate students across multiple institutions in both England and the United States. As a PhD student at Loughborough University, I served as a teaching assistant in both lecture-based and laboratory courses for materials engineering students, and I mentored several students on their research projects. At the University of Birmingham and Princeton University, I co-advised undergraduate students on summer internships and independent research projects.
